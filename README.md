Road Accident Data Analysis (2021-2022)

Road accidents are a significant concern worldwide, resulting in numerous injuries and fatalities. To gain insights into the patterns, causes, and trends of road accidents, a comprehensive data analysis was performed on road accident data spanning from 2021 to 2022.

1. Data Collection:
   - The analysis began with the collection of road accident data from multiple sources, including government agencies, law enforcement, and insurance companies. This data contained information about accident location, date, time, weather conditions, road type, vehicle types, and more.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Raw data often contains errors, missing values, and inconsistencies. Therefore, thorough data cleaning was performed to ensure data accuracy and reliability. This included handling missing data and outliers.

3. Data Visualization:
   - To provide a comprehensive understanding of road accidents during 2021-2022, various data visualization techniques were employed. These visualizations included bar charts, line graphs.

4. Year Column Addition:
   - To differentiate and analyze data specifically for the years 2021 and 2022, a "Year" column was added to the dataset. This allowed for the separation and focused analysis of accidents in each year, enabling the identification of any emerging trends or patterns.

5. Grouping and Aggregation:
   - Grouping the data by various factors such as location, time of day, weather conditions, and road type facilitated a more detailed analysis. Aggregating accident data into categories made it easier to identify high-risk areas, times, and contributing factors.

The road accident data analysis from 2021 to 2022 is an essential tool for understanding and addressing road safety issues. By performing data analysis and visualization, it is possible to work towards a safer road environment and reduce the human and economic toll of accidents.
